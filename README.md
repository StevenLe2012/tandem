# Tandem
Tandem is a mobile app for college students to explore meaningful experiences with their friends. Designed around the Stanford campus and Bay Area, Tandem encourages users to complete and add to a shared bucket list of activities. Alongside this, the app features a memory-capturing experience: friends can document moments together through photos, all saved in a collective group timeline. The app centers on close social ties: every action is tied to a group of friends. Users join or create private groups (with a code) to track memories, complete challenges, and revisit shared moments in a collective photo timeline.
