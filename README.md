# Tandem
Tandem is a college-based social mobile app for students interested in exploring more parts of their campus. It targets Stanford campus and the Bay Area first by centering on bucket list activities with friends. This app supports both collaborative and competitive modes: students can choose to complete challenges with friends or race against them to check off the most items first.

Tandem users will be able to personalize their own bucket list items while still sharing overlaps with others. We want Tandem to encourage agency while enabling social influence to promote activity and exploration that resonates with the users, together or apart.
